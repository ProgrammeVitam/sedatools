/**
 * Provides all classes to implement a Microsoft .pst messages container with
 * libpst library.
 * <p>
 * The java-libpst is a pure java library for the reading of Outlook PST and OST
 * files.
 * <p>
 * This library was originally based off the documentation created through the
 * fantastic reverse engineering effort made by the
 * [libpff](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpff) project. The library has
 * been improved with information provided by the release of the official PST
 * specs by Microsoft.
 * <p>
 * Thanks to Richard Johnson http://github.com/rjohnsondev
